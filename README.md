This repository contains the user interface (UI) design for an inventory management application. The UI is designed to provide a user-friendly and efficient way for users to manage their inventory and perform various inventory-related tasks.

### Features
* Dashboard: Offers a comprehensive overview of inventory, including total items, low-stock alerts, and recent activity.
* Product Management: Enables adding, editing, and removing products efficiently.
* Inventory Tracking: Monitors stock levels and item locations in real time.
* Stock Alerts: Sends notifications for low or out-of-stock items.
* Order Management: Facilitates order creation, tracking, and inventory restocking.
* Reporting & Analytics: Generates insights on inventory performance, sales trends, and stock movement.
* User Management: Controls user roles, access levels, and administrative permissions.

### Prerequisites 
* [Inventory-API](https://github.com/PSMRI/Inventory-API) module must be running
* JDK 17
* Nodejs v18.10.0
* MySQL

### Building from Source

1. **Generate Deployable WAR Files**
   ```bash
   mvn -B package --file pom.xml -P <profile_name>
   ```
   Available profiles: `dev`, `local`, `test`, and `ci`.  
   
2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Ensure that the correct environment variables are set by referring to the `src/environments/environment.ci.template` file. 

3. **CI Profile Specifics**
   Using the `ci` profile triggers the `build-ci` script from `package.json`.  
   This script generates an `environment.ci.ts` file, embedding all necessary environment variables for the build.
